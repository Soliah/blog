                <em><a href="http://aap.com.au">Australian Associated Press</a></em>
                <p class="position">Analyst Programmer</p>

            <div class="period">April 2011 — Present</div>

            <div class="description">
                <p>Played a major role in a variety of changes that have introduced efficiencies and increased productivity at AAP. These include but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Responsible for piloting the transition from Visual Source Safe to git, resulting in greatly increased levels of productivity and developer happiness. This was achieved by:</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Introducing DVCS and its benefits through presentations and collaborative discussion with the whole team.</li>
                        <li>Setup and administered a <a href="http://gitorious.org/">Gitorious</a> server to accelerate the adoption and used git on a pilot project with two other developers.</li>
                        <li>Mentored fellow developers on idiomatic use of git, including advanced topics such as rebasing and submodules.</li>
                        <li>Recently superseded the Gitorious server for <a href="https://enterprise.github.com">GitHub Enterprise</a> after heavy lobbying with the business. Benefits resulting with the adoption of GitHub Enterprise include a reduction in administrative overhead and leveraging of <a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">pull requests</a> as code review and GitHub wikis for project documentation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Pushed for the adoption of MVC3 over WebForms and successfully migrated large functionality of an existing .NET 3.5 WebForms <a href="http://www.mediapeople.com.au">website</a> to .NET 4 MVC3 with Razor. Was awarded developer of the year 2011 for the work performed on this site.</li>
                    <li>Belonged to the team that migrated aforementioned site to use the Solr indexing engine, replacing the previous slow and hard to maintain searching method of giant stored procedures. I was responsible for the interfacing of the Solr engine with our application via WCF.</li>
                    <li>Advocated for better practices in development including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using a combination of automated unit and integration testing.</li>
                            <li>Implementing dependancy injection via an IoC container to allow for easier writing of unit tests due to the code having higher SoC.</li>
                            <li>Using proper OO practices and design patterns.</li>
                            <li>Proper use of architectural design patterns like MVC and MVVM.</li>
                            <li>Better practices in website optimisation, such as use of a tools like <a href="http://getcassette.net/">Cassette</a> to implement asset management.</li>
