              <h1>Simplifying my work environment with iTerm2 and zsh</h1>
              <time>Jan 28, 2011</time>
              <p>After watching <a href="http://www.peepcode.com">PeepCode</a>&rsquo;s latest screencast called <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/play-by-play-bernhardt">Play by Play</a> (great cast btw), I really liked how Gary Bernhardt kept things simple by really only using one terminal window, taking full advantage of <code>^z</code> with <code>fg</code>. I decided to make a few changes to my prompt in an attempt to simplify my coding setup, taking inspiration from Gary&rsquo;s setup. Up until now I had actually been using MacVim for most of my coding, <code>⌘Tab</code>ing to switch between code and the Terminal. I also used lots of tabs in Terminal to separate tasks, though this often made it hard to find a particular session.</p>
              
              <h2>iTerm2</h2>
              
              <p>The first thing I did was drop Terminal. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/">iTerm2</a> is a great <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/iterm2home/iterm2-vs-terminal-app">alternative</a> to Terminal. The main reason I chose iTerm2 though, was because it has a fullscreen option. This resonated with the idea of a single window to work in. <code>⌘↵</code> allows me to switch between fullscreen and window mode.</p>
              
              <h2>oh-my-zsh</h2>
              
              <p>I was already using zsh for my shell, in addition to using the great scripts provided by <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a>. I have made my changes to get my prompt looking like the following so feel free to use my <a href="https://github.com/Soliah/oh-my-zsh">fork</a>. My theme slightly extends the default git information shown on the prompt, taking inspiration from Gary&rsquo;s time indicator. </p>
              
              <p>The <code>*</code> indicates dirty and <code>?</code> indicates untracked changes.</p>
              
              <p><img src="/images/posts/2011-01-28-001.png" /></p>
              
              <p>As time goes by the colour of the time changes from green to yellow to red. I got rid of the fatal error and changed the time since last commit to include days and hours instead of just minutes. I&rsquo;ve also made the color neutral when the working directory is clean.</p>
              
              <p>All of this is available at my <a href="https://github.com/Soliah/oh-my-zsh">fork</a>.</p>
              
              <h2>vim</h2>
              
              <p>This process wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without some modifications to my <code>.vimrc</code>. I really liked the current line highlighting and the tab completion, so I added it to mine. I also made a few colour changes to the completion menu. I&rsquo;ve put my <code>.vimrc</code> up on <a href="https://github.com/Soliah/dotfiles">github</a>. For those that aren&rsquo;t familiar with vim, Henrik Nyh has a great introduction on his <a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/2011/01/textmate-to-vim-with-training-wheels">blog</a>.</p>
