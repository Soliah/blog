              <h1>Jekyll, Compass and SASS, Disqus</h1>
              <time>Jan 27, 2011</time>
              <h2>Jekyll</h2>
              
              <p>After a minor trial with Posterous I decided that I didn&rsquo;t particularly like the web management interface nor did I want to post via email. I also found my blog to be quite slow and unresponsive at times. I did a bit of research and decided to take advantage of github&rsquo;s <a href="http://pages.github.com">pages</a> functionality using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a static site generator that converts the posts I write in markdown into a complete static HTML website. github takes the master branch of a repository named <code>username.github.com</code> and serves the content. If github detects the prescence of a Jekyll website, it will perform the necessary conversion into static HTML. (github looks for folders and files prefixed with an <code>_</code> to determine if the repository is a Jekyll site).</p>
              
              <p>github pages also allows for custom domains. Create a file called <code>CNAME</code> in your repository and add a line with the name of your domain in it. Then create a <code>CNAME</code> record for your domain pointing to <code>username.github.com</code>. Commit and after the DNS record propogates the blog should be accessible at the custom domain.</p>
              
              <h2>Compass &amp; SASS</h2>
              
              <p>I&rsquo;ve always hated how there was so much code repetition in CSS and <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> addresses that problem with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, an extensions of CSS3. SASS provides nested selectors, variables, mixins and a bunch of other cool stuff. The way it works is as you&rsquo;re writing SASS styles, Compass watches your site directory and automatically &ldquo;compiles&rdquo; your SASS into standard CSS. Compass also has built in Rails and Blueprint support.</p>
              
              <p>I should mention that SASS actually has two syntax options for writing styles (this confused me at first). There is the default option, &ldquo;Sassy CSS&rdquo; (file extensions <code>.scss</code>) which is a superset of CSS. All standard CSS styles will work without any changes if you choose this syntax. The alternative is just called &ldquo;SASS&rdquo; (file extensions <code>.sass</code>) and is an indented oriented syntax inspired by HAML. I found the latter to be much more concise and clear than Sassy CSS.</p>
              
              <h2>Disqus</h2>
              
              <p><a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> has been around for ages now and is pretty much the go to for a comment system if one doesn&rsquo;t want to roll their own (and in this case, not possible as I wanted to use github pages). There wasn&rsquo;t anything tricky with setting up Disqus. Just had to follow the instructions after signing up.</p>
              
              <h2>To Do</h2>
              
              <p>I still have more to do though:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li class="strike">Create a custom 404 page.</li>
                <li>Add navigation of some sort.</li>
                <li class="strike">Date for the posts would be nice.</li>
                <li class="strike">RSS feed.</li>
                <li>Come up with a name. (My name in Japanese doesn&rsquo;t cut it).</li>
                <li>Google Analytics maybe?</li>
              </ul>
