              <h1>Jumba VPS Rails Setup</h1>
              <time>Nov 18, 2010</time>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.jumba.com.au/vps">Jumba VPS&#39;</a> are a great affordable way to get a VPS for testing and basic hosting. However, setting up a VPS is not easy and I ran into a few road blocks getting Rails running on my server. I decided to document what I did to get Rails running in the context of a Jumba VPS so that others can get up and running, but also because I actually started to forget what I had done.</p>
              
              <h2>DNS Records</h2>
              
              <p>After purchasing a VPS (and a domain if you don&rsquo;t already have one) you&rsquo;ll need to create an A record pointing to the IP of your VPS. You can manage your domains with Jumba at their <a href="http://domains.jumba.com.au">domain management</a> page.</p>
              
              <h2>Users and sudo</h2>
              
              <p>The default Ubuntu image that is given on Jumba&rsquo;s VPS is configured a little differently from a standard Ubuntu install. This is specifically to do with the handling of sudo. Ubuntu handles root privileges by disabling the root account and giving users in the admin groups the ability to run tasks with root permissions. However, the Jumba Ubuntu image doesn&rsquo;t have this group, has the root account enabled (this is required for Parallels) and the corresponding configuration in the <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file also doesn&rsquo;t reflect this. Let&rsquo;s change this to regular Ubuntu behaviour.</p>
              
              <p>First, SSH in as root and create the admin group. The group ID of <code>106</code> is Ubuntu&rsquo;s default group ID for the admin group.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">groupadd -g 106 admin</pre>
              <p>Next create a user for yourself and follow the prompts. Pick a reasonably strong password, as that will be the password used with sudo (it won&rsquo;t be used for SSH as we&rsquo;ll setup key authentication later).</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">adduser </pre>
              <p>Now add your user to the admin group.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">adduser admin</pre>
              <p>Next the <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file needs to be edited. </p>
              <pre class="highlight text">visudo</pre>
              <p>Make sure this line <code>%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL</code> remains commented out. This line allows users with sudo access to execute <code>sudo</code> without a password. This is bad from a security standpoint so make sure it&rsquo;s commented out. Add the following to the bottom of the file to enable sudo access to users in the admin group.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL</pre>
              <p>Now try to SSH into the machine with the newly created user account and password.</p>
              
              <h2>System Locale and NTP</h2>
              
              <p>We can now use sudo to run anything that is required as root. Let&rsquo;s update the VPS and set the default locale.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">sudo apt-get update&#x000A;sudo apt-get upgrade</pre>
              <p>Whilst I was setting up webmin (I&rsquo;ll get to that later) I ran into a locale issue. The default locale is not setup on the Jumba VPS. First edit the <code>/var/lib/locales/supported.d/local</code>. Create this if it doesn&rsquo;t exist and add the following line, and any others that you wish to have enabled.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">sudo vim /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local&#x000A;en_AU UTF-8</pre>
              <p>Then run the following to generate the locales.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales</pre>
              <p>Edit <code>/etc/default/locale</code> to setup your VPS&#39; default locale.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">sudo vim /etc/default/locale&#x000A;LANG=&quot;en_AU:UTF-8&quot;</pre>
              <p>Reboot the container and the locale should be correctly set.</p>
              
              <p>Let&rsquo;s also install ntp to keep the time accurate.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">sudo apt-get install ntp ntpdate</pre>
              <h2>SSH</h2>
              
              <p>An unsecure SSH daemon is probably the most common way a server gets rooted. Locking down the SSH server is very important when running an unmanaged VPS so it&rsquo;s strongly recommended that you do something similar. The following should be a good starting point to getting SSH secure on <em>any</em> VPS.</p>
              
              <h2>Disable root logins</h2>
              
              <p>This is an obvious one, and I think anyone who has any experience with administering a server would tell you to do this. There is no reason to login as root as almost any task that needs to be run as root can be done via <code>sudo</code>.</p>
              
              <p>To disable root logins edit the <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> file and add:</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">PermitRootLogin no</pre>
              <p>Reload the SSH daemon configuration by calling <code>sudo /etc/init.d/ssh reload</code></p>
              
              <h2>Key Authentication</h2>
              
              <p>Key authentication is an alternative to the traditional username and password method of authentication. Rather than using a username and password, users can create a matched private and public key pair. The public key resides on the server and the private key is kept by the user. When ever an authentication request is made the user must present his/her private key to the server.</p>
              
              <p>To create a public/private key pair on Linux/OSX, run the following on your local machine.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">ssh-keygen -t rsa</pre>
              <p>It&rsquo;s <em>strongly</em> recommended you pick a paraphrase. This will create public and private keys <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> and <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>. Now, the public key needs to be placed on the server. We can use the <code>scp</code> command to upload the public key.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@yourdomain:.</pre>
              <p>Now SSH into your VPS and run the following to place your public key in the appropriate place:</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">cat id_rsa.pub &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2</pre>
              <p>Logout of your VPS and try to SSH in again.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">ssh username@yourdomain</pre>
              <p>You should be able to login without any password requests. <em>Only</em> if this works should you proceed with the following: Edit the <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> file again and add:</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">PasswordAuthentication no&#x000A;ChallengeResponseAuthentication no</pre>
              <p>This will disable password logins and only allow key based authentication.</p>
              
              <h2>Changing Port</h2>
              
              <p>This is an optional step but it&rsquo;s also a very easy way to stop the standard script kiddies from port scanning your server and detecting that SSH is enabled. By changing the default port of 22 to something uncommon the number of attacks that you&rsquo;ll see will most likeley drop significantly. Just change the line <code>Port 22</code> to something else:</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">Port xxxx</pre>
              <h2>Webmin</h2>
              
              <p>Webmin is a web based administrative tool for Linux/Unix based servers. It allows you to manage almost anything you could do from the command line from a nice web interface.</p>
              
              <p>First install webmin dependancies.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">sudo apt-get install perl libnet-ssleay-perl openssl libauthen-pam-perl libpam-runtime libio-pty-perl libmd5-perl</pre>
              <p>Then download the latest webmin debian package:</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">wget -O webmin-current.deb http://www.webmin.com/download/deb/webmin-current.deb</pre>
              <p>Then use dpkg to install:</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">sudo dpkg -i webmin-current.deb </pre>
              <p>This will now allow you to go to <code>https://:10000</code>. You can login with the <code>root</code> account.</p>
              
              <h2>Virtualmin</h2>
              
              <p>Virtualmin is a tool to manage multiple virtual servers. It makes managing multiple websites on one server extremely easy.</p>
              
              <p>First install ProFTPd.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">sudo apt-get install proftpd</pre>
              <p>Then follow the instructions at <code>http://www.webmin.com/vdownload.html</code> to install virtualmin. You may want to edit the default Virtual Host template under Virtualmin &gt; System Settings &gt; Server Templates &gt; Apache website (Dropdown)</p>
              
              <p>For example, I dislike the <code>www</code> in front of my domains so I added this to the template:</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">RewriteEngine on &#x000A;RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.${DOM} [NC] &#x000A;RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ http://${DOM}/$1 [R=301] </pre>
              <p>I also added some log file locations</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">ErrorLog ${HOME}/logs/error_log&#x000A;CustomLog ${HOME}/logs/access_log combined</pre>
              <h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
              
              <p>Now that the system is properly locked down we can move on to getting Rails working. This will be a full setup of Rails, including how to deploy Rails apps using Capistrano. Make sure you have followed the key authentication section above, as that is required to get all this working.</p>
              
              <p>First thing is to install ruby and some dependancies for RubyGems.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">sudo apt-get install ruby build-essential libopenssl-ruby ruby1.8-dev</pre>
              <p>Next we have to install RubyGems. The recommended method of doing this is to not use the package management system. Instead it&rsquo;s best to install it from source. The latest version as of this article is 1.3.7.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/70696/rubygems-1.3.7.tgz</pre>
              <p>Extract and run the setup.rb</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">tar xvzf rubygems-1.3.7.tgz&#x000A;cd rubygems-1.3.7&#x000A;sudo ruby setup.rb</pre>
              <p>Once this is done you can delete the tgz and the rubygems-1.3.7 folder. RubyGems installs the standard scripts with a <code>1.8</code> suffix. We&rsquo;ll have to create symlinks:</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gem1.8 /usr/local/bin/gem&#x000A;sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ruby1.8 /usr/local/bin/ruby&#x000A;sudo ln -s /usr/bin/rdoc1.8 /usr/local/bin/rdoc&#x000A;sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ri1.8 /usr/local/bin/ri&#x000A;sudo ln -s /usr/bin/irb1.8 /usr/local/bin/irb</pre>
              <p>Now we can install rails. On a VPS it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to not install ri/rdoc. You may also want to include some other gems as needed.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">sudo gem install rails --no-rdoc --no-ri</pre>
              <p>Next we can install the passenger gem. This is recommended over using apt-get as the version available in apt is rather old.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">sudo gem install passenger --no-rdoc --no-ri</pre>
              <p>After the gem is installed you&rsquo;ll have a new command available to compile the passenger module for Apache2. Run:</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">sudo passenger-install-apache2-module</pre>
              <p>Follow the instructions that the install presents. There a number of dependancies that are required. The installer will tell you which ones are needed. Once this is done all that&rsquo;s left is to create virtual hosts for your Rails apps.</p>
              
              <p>Here is an example of a virtual host for a Rails app. The <code>DocumentRoot</code> should point to the <code>public</code> directory of your Rails app. Passenger will then take care of the rest.</p>
              <pre class="highlight text">ServerName example.com&#x000A;&#x000A;DocumentRoot /var/www/public&#x000A;    AllowOverride all&#x000A;    Options -MultiViews&#x000A;LogLevel warn</pre>
              <p>So thats it for now. There are some other things I might add later on.</p>
