title: Simplifying my work environment with iTerm2 and zsh
---

After watching [PeepCode's](www.peepcode.com) latest screencast called Play by Play (great cast btw), I really liked how Gary Bernhardt kept things simple by really only using one terminal window, taking full advantage of `^z` with `fg`. I decided to make a few changes to my prompt in an attempt to simplify coding setup, taking inspiration from Gary's setup. Up until now I had actually been using MacVim for most of my coding, using `âŒ˜Tab` to switch between it and the Terminal. I also used lots of tabs in Terminal to separate tasks, though this often made it hard to find a particular session.

## iTerm2

The first thing I did was drop Terminal. [iTerm2](http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/) is a great [alternative](http://sites.google.com/site/iterm2home/iterm2-vs-terminal-app) to Terminal. The main reason I chose iTerm2 though, was because it has a fullscreen option. This resonated with the idea of a single window to work in.

## oh-my-zsh

I was already using zsh for my shell, in addition to using the great scripts provided by [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). I have made my changes to get my prompt looking like the following so feel free to use my [fork](https://github.com/Soliah/oh-my-zsh). My theme slightly extends the default git information shown on the prompt, taking inspiration from Gary's time indicator.

I got rid of the fatal error and added hours instead of just minutes. I've also made the color neutral when the working directory is clean.

All of this is available at my [fork](https://github.com/Soliah/oh-my-zsh).
